Sundries

1. sundries/thread.c, my first multi-threading example.

2. sundries/detach.c, I tried out detached threads.

3. sundries/parallel.c, demonstrates how to utilize two threads for parallel
   computing.

4. sundries/mutex.c, a demonstration of two threads competing to modify a global
   variable simultaneously, using a Mutex to ensure an accurate result.

5. sundries/wake.c,
   In multithreading, relying solely on 'locks' is not enough. If a consumer 
   thread finds the basket empty. It cannnot just keep staring at it in an 
   infinite loop (which wastes too much CPU time).

   Instead, it should go to sleep. When the producer adds something, it then 
   wakes the consumer up.

   To implement this type of 'communication', we need to use a condition
   variable.

6. sundries/pstack.c, a demonstration that different threads have their own
   separate stacks.

7. sundries/ssize.c, a demonstration of modifying the stack size for a thread.


Mini Labs

1. mlabs/pstree.c, this is a simplified version of pstree, which is part of the
   M1 lab.


Labs

1. labs/baremetal, a minimal i386 bare-metal program featuring serial port
   output and video memory (VGA) writing.
